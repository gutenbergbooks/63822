<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE WORLD IS ROUND.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The following is an extract from a
modernized version of "The Voyages
and Travels of Sir John Mandeville,
Kt." He set out in 1322 and was thirty
years in making his "Voyages and
Travels," an account of which he wrote
in French, and this was afterwards
Englished, probably by some one else.</p>

<p class='c005'>"And men may prove by experience
and their understanding, that if a man
found passages by ships, he might go
by ships all round the world, above
and beneath; which I prove thus, after
what I have seen. For I have been
towards the parts of Brabant, and
found by the astrolabe that the polar
star is fifty-three degrees high; and
further, in Germany and Bohemia, it
has fifty-eight degrees; and still further
towards the north it is sixty-two degrees
and some minutes; for I myself
have measured it by the astrolabe.
Now you shall know that opposite the
polar star is the other star, called antarctic,
as I have said before. These
two stars are fixed; and about them
all the firmament turns as a wheel that
turns on its axle-tree; so that those
stars bear the firmament in two equal
parts; so that it has as much above as
it has beneath.... And if I had
company and shipping to go further, I
believe certainly that we should have
seen all the roundness of the firmament
all about. For, as I have told
you before, the half of the firmament
is between the two stars, which half I
have seen. And the other half I have
seen towards the north, under the
polar star, sixty-two degrees and ten
minutes; and towards the south, I
have seen under the antarctic thirty-three
degrees and sixteen minutes;
and the half of the firmament in all
contains but one hundred and eighty
degrees, of which I have seen sixty-two
on the one part, and thirty-three
on the other, which makes ninety-five
degrees, and nearly the half of a degree;
so that I have seen all the firmament
except eighty-four degrees and the
half of a degree; and that is not the
fourth part of the firmament. By
which I tell you, certainly, that men
may go all round the world, as well
under as above, and return to their
country, if they had company, and
<a id='Page_104'></a>shipping, and guides; and always they
would find men, lands, and isles, as
well as in our part of the world. For
they who are towards the antarctic are
directly feet opposite feet of them who
dwell under the polar star; as well as
we and they that dwell under us are
feet opposite feet. For all parts of sea
and land have their opposites, habitable
or passable....</p>

<p class='c005'>"They, therefore, that start from the
west to go towards Jerusalem, as many
days as they go upward to go thither,
in so many days may they go from
Jerusalem to other confines of the superficialities
of the earth beyond.
And when men go beyond that distance,
towards India and to the foreign
isles, they are proceeding on the roundness
of the earth and the sea, under
our country. And therefore hath it
befallen many times of a thing that I
have heard told when I was young,
how a worthy man departed once from
our country to go and discover the
world; and so he passed India, and
the isles beyond India, where are more
than five thousand isles; and so long
he went by sea and land, and so environed
the world by many seasons,
that he found an isle where he heard
people speak his own language, calling
an oxen in the plough such words
as men speak to beasts in his own
country, whereof he had great wonder,
for he knew not how it might be. But
I say that he had gone so long, by
land and sea, that he had gone all
round the earth; that he was come
again to his own borders, if he would
have passed forth till he had found his
native country. But he turned again
from thence, from whence he was come,
and so he lost much painful labor, as
himself said, a great while after, when
he was coming home; for it befell after,
that he went into Norway, and the
tempest of the sea carried him to an
isle; and when he was in that isle, he
knew well that it was the isle where
he had heard his own language spoken
before, and the calling of the oxen at
the plough. But it seems to simple
and unlearned men that men may not
go under the earth, but that they would
fall from under towards the heaven.
But that may not be any more than
we fall towards heaven from the earth
where we are; for from what part of
the earth that men dwell, either above
or beneath, it seems always to them
that they go more right than any other
people. And right as it seems to us
that they be under us, so it seems to
them that we are under them; for if a
man might fall from the earth unto the
firmament, by greater reason the
earth and the sea, that are so great
and so heavy, should fall to the firmament;
but that may not be, and therefore
saith our Lord God, 'He hangeth
the earth upon nothing.'</p>

<p class='c005'>"Although it be possible so to go all
round the world, yet of a thousand persons
<a id='Page_105'></a>not one might happen to return
to his country; for, from the greatness
of the earth and sea, men may go by a
thousand different ways, that no one
could be sure of returning exactly to
the parts he came from, unless by
chance or by the grace of God; for the
earth is very large, and contains in
roundness and circuit, above and beneath,
20,425 miles, after the opinion
of the old wise astronomers; and, after
my little wit, it seems to me, saving
their reverence, that it is more; for I
say thus: let there be imagined a figure
that has a great compass; and about
the point of the great compass, which
is called the centre, let there be made
another little compass; then, afterwards,
let the great compass be divided
by lines in many parts, and all the lines
meet at the centre; so that in as many
parts as the great compass shall be
divided, in so many shall the little one
that is about the centre be divided, although
the spaces be less. Let the
great compass be represented for the
firmament, and the little compass for
the earth; now the firmament is divided
by astronomers into twelve signs, and
every sign is divided into thirty degrees.
Also let the earth be divided into as
many parts as the firmament, and let
every part answer to a degree of the
firmament; and I know well that, after
the authorities in astronomy, seven
hundred furlongs of earth answer to a
degree of the firmament, that is eighty-seven
miles and four furlongs. Now,
multiplied by three hundred and sixty
times, it makes 31,500 miles, each of
eight furlongs, according to miles of
our country. So much hath the earth
in circuit after my opinion and understanding."</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'>THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>There is in this fast age a fast-growing
tendency, on the part of many so-called
English grammarians, to set
aside the uses of the subjunctive mood
and to attempt to make the indicative
perform the functions of both. In the
first place, they are striving to do that
which is impossible; in the second
place, by their efforts to make the indicative
do the work of both and by
their lack of effort to see and understand
and explain the "subtle distinctions
involved in the use of the subjunctive
mood," they have entangled the mind
of the student of English grammar in
a net-work of obscurity and have cast
the dust of falsehood into his eyes and
have thrown the whole subject of the
uses of moods into a fog of ambiguity.
Many say but little on the subject of
moods, and it would have been a great
deal better for the student if many of
them had said nothing, unless they had
approached nearer to the truth. Some
in their definitions for the term 'mood,'
imply, if they do not say positively,
that mood is a certain manner of using
verbs. No definition could be more
<a id='Page_106'></a>misleading, and none at all would have
been far better. "Most English grammars
say that the subjunctive mood is
used to express uncertainty or to state
an action conditionally." This shows
again that they are stepping in the dark
and that it would be best for them to
stand still until their eyes opened, for
nothing can be farther from the truth.
When an uncertainty or a conditionality
has reference to actual fact, it not
only <i>may be</i> but <i>must be</i> expressed by
a statement in which the indicative
mood is used; as, 'If the man is guilty,
he ought to be hanged.' Here we have
a sentence in which the speaker is dealing
with a <i>fact</i>, a <i>reality</i>, and one about
which he is uncertain and for that reason
puts a condition in his statement.
This gives us a sentence in which both
uncertainty and conditionality are expressed,
and at the same time one in
which the indicative mood is employed;
and, if space permitted, we could give
numberless examples from good authors.
"Of course everybody knows
that the subjunctive mood is employed
in some sorts of conditional statements;"
but this certainly fails to prove
that the subjunctive mood is <i>necessary</i>
to the expression of a condition. In
most conditional statements, there is
generally some such conjunction as 'if,'
'lest,' 'unless,' 'though' or 'although'
preceding the verb, or else the inverted
position of parts of the sentence is such
as to show the condition without conjunction.
'If thine enemy be hungry,
give him bread to eat.'&mdash;<i>Prov. XV., 21</i>;
'Cursed be my tribe, if I forgive him.'&mdash;<i>Sh.
Merch. Ven. I., 1</i>; 'Though he
slay me, yet will I trust in him.'&mdash;<i>Job
XIII., 15</i>; 'My son, if thine heart be
wise, my heart shall rejoice.'-<i>Prov.
XXIII., 15</i>; 'If this be treason, make
the most of it.'&mdash;<i>Patrick Henry</i>; 'Beware
lest any man spoil you through
philosophy and vain deceit.'&mdash;<i>Colos.
III., 18</i>; and, 'If a man desire the office
of a bishop, he desireth a good work.'&mdash;<i>I
Tim. III., 1</i>;&mdash;these are a few examples
in which conditions are expressed
by conjunctions; and we find
that condition is expressed by something
else than verbs or the moods of
verbs. Therefore, if the subjunctive
mood is not necessary to express a
condition, we are forced to the conclusion
that its function is something
far different from that of expressing
mere conditionality, even when it is
used in a conditional statement. And,
when we find both a conditional conjunction
and a subjunctive mood in the
same statement, we are forced to believe
that the subjunctive mood adds
some new force. 'If he be taken, he
shall never more be feared.'&mdash;<i>Sh. King
Lear II. I., 8</i>; 'If a man say, I love
God, and hateth his brother, he is a
liar.'&mdash;<i>I John IV, 20</i>; 'Tell me ...
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice.'&mdash;<i>Rich.
II. I., i, 9</i>, are examples in
which the subjunctive mood does not
<a id='Page_107'></a>express condition, but something more
important.</p>

<p class='c005'>Others of these so-called grammarians
speak of moods as being certain
"verb-forms," and thus far they are
correct; but they err when they say
that, because in the course of time the
distinctive marks have been worn away
and the indicative and subjunctive
forms have become alike in appearance,
they are identical, and speak of
them as "indicative-subjunctive forms."
Though two verbs may be spelled alike
and look and sound alike, yet that is no
reason for saying that they are alike in
grammatical function or in the same
mood. '<i>Depart</i> from me, all ye workers
of iniquity.'&mdash;<i>Luke XIII., 27</i>; 'When
ye <i>depart</i> thence, shake off the dust
under your feet ...'&mdash;<i>Mark VI.,
11.</i> Here we have two verbs alike in
appearance; but who would say that
they are alike in function? or who
would dare call them "indicative-imperative
forms"? It is no more unreasonable
to talk of "indicative-imperative
forms" than to talk of "indicative-subjunctive
forms." "To talk of
'indicative-subjunctive forms' is like
talking of a 'round-square hole.'" May
the Goddess of Grammar look with
compassion upon such mistakes, and, if
the offenders ever repent, by her grace
grant them full pardon, for the school-boy
never can!</p>

<p class='c005'>The subjunctive mood has a far more
important and almost entirely different
function from those commonly assigned
to it. The word 'mood' comes from
the Latin <i>modus</i> (manner) and, as used
with reference to verbs, denotes certain
variations of their form, by means of
which the speaker can show the manner
in which the action, being or state
of being is connected in his own mind
with the things spoken of. The subjunctive
mood includes those forms of
the verb which the speaker must use
when he wishes to show that his statement
or supposition is connected in his
mind with a matter of mere <i>conception</i>
and not a matter of real <i>fact</i>, independent
of his own thought about it.
The term 'subjunctive' comes from the
Latin <i>subjungere</i> (to join on-to) and
was applied to this mood because it is
used more frequently in sub-joined
clauses than in principal clauses; but
its name does not limit it to dependent
clauses, for we have many examples
that will prove to the contrary; as
'This single crime, in my judgment,
were sufficient to condemn him.'&mdash;<i>Duncan's
Cicero, p. 82</i>; 'Be he who he will.'&mdash;<i>Sh.
R.</i> (<i>Koch</i>); 'It were long to
tell.'&mdash;<i>Byron's Giaour</i>; 'To love thee
were to love myself.'&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost,
IX., 959</i>; 'The rest were long to tell.&mdash;<i>Ib.
I., 507</i>; Compare the force of the
subjunctive in these with its force in
the following examples: 'Whatever
betide, be thou at least kind to my
memory.'&mdash;<i>Byron's Marino Faliero II.,
1</i>; 'He stood resigned to the decree,
<a id='Page_108'></a>whatever it were.'&mdash;<i>Ib. I., 2.</i> Then, if
we consider it worth our while to distinguish
in our statements between
those made in connection with real
matter of <i>fact</i> and those made in
connection with matter of mere <i>conception</i>,
the subjunctive mood must
remain in our language, for it is the
only means by which we can show
this important distinction. When ever
we lay aside the subjunctive mood we
lay aside one of <i>the</i> powers of our language.</p>

<p class='c004'>The farmer has at last begun to think
for himself, and, as a natural consequence,
he is acting in defense of himself
and his rights. This can truthfully be
called an age of organizations. Men
of all professions and occupations are
uniting themselves in associations.
From this general approval, one cannot
but conclude that such organizations,
well conducted, are beneficial in
some way to their respective classes.
It, therefore, behooves the farmer so to
prepare himself as to be able to declare
and maintain his rights among the various
other co-operative bodies of the
business world. No one, then, will say
that the Farmer's Alliance, <i>if conducted
aright</i>, will not prove successful in the
accomplishment of the farmer's purpose;
but even the farmer will admit
that the natural tendency of such organizations
is towards politics. So soon
as this corrupting feature takes root in
the Farmer's Alliance, not only must
the Alliance die, but the socio-political
status of the farmer will be lowered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Self-reliance is one of the first things
that a college student should learn.
At the very beginning of his college
<a id='Page_109'></a>course he should determine to discard
all unnecessary aid, it matters not how
anxious he may be to take a high stand
in his class and in his Society. Hard
labor is the price of all excellence, and
if he is not willing to exert himself he
should be satisfied with low grades, &amp;c.
The young man who uses translations
to be able to get along in his class, and
plagiarizes in his Society in order to
win, among a certain class of students,
the reputation of being a good speaker,
could not possibly devise a better plan
by which to ruin himself. Such a student
may get up a short-lived reputation,
but he will be found out eventually
and will experience a great mortification.
The student who does not
rely in the main on his own exertions
may go to college all his life and yet
not be truly educated. Colleges do
not exist for the purpose of cramming
a student with text-book knowledge,
but to teach him to use his mental
powers to the best advantage. Every
student should use his own brains, and
not rely upon translations or fellow
students, and thus "beat" his way
through college. Let self-reliance be
the motto of every student at Trinity.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c005'>The study of history in American
colleges has made wonderful progress
during the latter part of this century.
But still there are many people who
consider it almost unorthodox to study
anything but the present. Those who
venture to write about Socrates, Plato,
or Aristotle, they would consider as fit
companions for the monks of the Middle
Ages who thought that seclusion
and a little knowledge of Latin constituted
the essence of true religion.
There is something in "the olden time"
to enlist our love and win our admiration.
To many a student, those old
Druid priests, sacrificing human victims
under Britain's primeval oaks, are objects
of wonder. There is an inexplicable
peculiarity in their midnight sacrifices
which excites the curiosity of
the youthful and stimulates the reflecting
mind to greater research. But this
is not all. The best way to improve
the present is to profit by the examples
of the past. The great military
chieftains of modern times have always
studied with great care and consideration
the campaigns of Alexander, Caesar
and Hannibal, and have therefore
escaped defeat. So should every political
leader carefully study the policy of
Sparta under Lycurgus, of Beotia under
Epaminondas, of Athens under Solon
and Pericles, and of France under
Charlemagne. Indeed, every citizen
should have a knowledge of the social
and political history of fallen empires,
monarchies and democracies in order
to avoid their Scylla and Charybdis.</p>

<p class='c005'><a id='Page_110'></a>William I., King of Prussia and Emperor
of Germany, though dead, will
ever live in the memory of both American
and European people through
the lasting results of the past half century's
events. No other person has
been so uninterruptedly successful in
the accomplishment of his plans. No
other monarch has held as he has, the
affections and conserved the trusts of his
people. Hence, it is natural and proper
that they should mourn his loss,
and tremble at the uncertainty of finding
in a successor all the qualities of
their late ruler. The Emperor Frederick
is slowly dying. It was hoped
that on his succession to the throne
the German policy would be liberalized
and that the strength which the
Empire had acquired would be manifested
in allowing more freedom in the
expression of opinion and in political
action. But such hopes must soon prove
vain; for the crown will soon pass to
the Emperor William's grandson, who
is thought to be of quite a different cast
from his heroic and hapeless father.
He will have the counsel and assistance
of Bismarck, but nevertheless the
world will breathe uneasily for months,
and, it may be, for years to come.
The great question with the German
people is, will the change bring in its
train continued peace or a beginning of
war.</p>

<p class='c005'>The recent speeches of several of the
most prominent Republicans in the
United States Senate, notably that of
Mr. Ingalls, reflects discredit not only
upon them, but also upon their constituents
throughout the North. They
prove conclusively that sectional hatred
has not yet ceased to exist among a
large class of people at the North, and
that they still cherish a malignant
feeling of resentment toward the South.
The spirit displayed in these speeches
is contemptible, and the very essence
of narrow-mindedness; it would ill become
the Middle Ages, much less this
enlightened nineteenth century. It is
in vain that appeals are made to cause
the North and the South to forget the
past, and become re-united in the
bonds of brotherhood and affection, so
long as representatives of the North
pursue such a virulent course toward
the Southern people. Mr. Ingalls'
speech proves him to be a partisan
demagogue, and unworthy to hold his
present high position. The best class
of people of both sections have long
since become disgusted with bloody-shirt
politics and hearing sectional
feeling appealed to, and should see to
it that broad-minded men are chosen
to represent them in Congress. Then,
and not till then, will both sections become
fully reconciled.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Temperance Movement</span>: or, The Conflict
between Man and Alcohol. By Henry
William Blair, United States Senator from
New Hampshire. Boston, William E.
Smythe Company. 8vo., pp. xxiv 583.
1888.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every voter should read this book.
The author, who, by reason of his
many philanthropic efforts and high
political position, commands the confidence
of all, presents for consideration
a comprehensive statement of the
nature and the physical and moral effects
of alcoholic drinks, discusses proposed
remedies for the evil it entails,
dwells on prohibition, and gives an historical
sketch of the efforts made in
temperance reform. Those who wish
to understand this rapidly growing
question would find what they desire in
this book. The argument is substantiated
by facts, and many valuable tables
are given. Maps, colored plates showing
the effects of alcohol on the physical
organs, and fifty-eight full page portraits
of leading workers in the temperence
cause, together with a clear,
forcible style, good type and attractive
binding, add much to the general desirableness
of the work. It contains
a portrait of Prof. J. C. Price, of Zion
Wesley College, Salisbury, N. C., and
mention is made of him as "one of the
foremost temperance orators now living."
An elaborate index and an
appendix containing Justice Harlan's
opinion on the Kansas cases closes the
volume.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Lessons in English Grammar.</span> By Alfred
H. Welsh (Ohio State University), Author
of "Development of English Literature and
Language," &amp;c. pp. vii, 237. Chicago:
John C. Buckbee and Company. 1888.</p>

<p class='c008'>This work begins with a treatise on
the origin, growth and relations of the
English language, which might well
form the introductory chapter to any
brief work on English literature. In a
few words the story of our language is
told from the 5th century when the
Angles, Saxons and Jutes landed in
England to the present time. The
fact may also be noted that the author
in his treatment of the alphabet, of
nouns, and of pronouns, has departed
slightly from the "old order of things,"
and avoided some errors made by other
grammarians.</p>

<p class='c005'>The remainder of the book abounds
in many errors and contains very little
worthy of commendation. The Parts
of Speech are defined inductively, and
this "Induction," which generally occupies
pages of preparatory explanation,
leaves the pupil in such a
state of bewilderment that he does not
recognize the proposition when it is
reached. It is to be regretted that the
verb should ever have received such
treatment as it has here. The disposition
of the Moods is almost shocking.
The much-mooted "Potential" Mood
<a id='Page_112'></a>with its 'may,' 'can,' 'must,' 'might,'
'could,' 'would,' or 'should,' is given
special stress, while the Subjunctive is
utterly rejected on the following
grounds: (1) "There is no peculiar
form for it; (2) there is no peculiar
meaning for it, it being indicative or
potential in meaning according as it
has the indicative or potential form."</p>

<p class='c005'>The first objection is frivolous from
the fact that in modern English other
parts of speech are open to the same
criticism. The author himself tells us
the word '<i>that</i>' may be either a <i>relative</i>
or a <i>demonstrative</i> pronoun; yet is not
the <i>form</i> the same? The second objection
is likewise groundless. [See
article "Subjunctive Mood," p. 104,
<span class='sc'>Archive</span>.]</p>

<p class='c005'>The absurdity of a Potential Mood
is well shown by the following from
Mason: "The so-called Potential Mood
is the product of a series of blunders
and misconceptions, and has been discarded
by all the best authorities. 'I
can write' or 'I must write' is not a
<i>mood</i> at all in the sense in which 'I
write,' 'I should write,' or 'Write
[thou],' is a mood. If you take a subject
(say 'John'), and a verb (say
'write'), when the Indicative, Subjunctive,
or Imperative Mood is used,
the <i>act of writing</i> predicated of John
in some manner, affirmatively or negatively,
as matter of fact, as matter of
conception, or as matter of volition.
But if we say 'John can write,' or
'John must write,' we predicate of
John not <i>writing</i>, but the <i>ability</i> to
write, or the <i>obligation</i> to write, which
is a totally different affair. Nobody
thinks of giving the name 'Potential
Mood' to such combinations as 'Scribere
possum,' 'Ich kann schreiben,' or 'Je
puis écrire.' Its retention in English
grammar is anomalous and absurd."</p>

D. D., New York. Phillips and
Hunt, pp., 182, 16m. 1887.</p>

<p class='c008'>This work is the expansion of a line
of thought set forth by Dr. Dorchester
in a sermon preached at Chlemsford,
Mass., in response to the Unitarian
minister at that place, who challenged
the doctrines of all other denominations.
The author discusses the origin,
character, influence and polity of the
Methodist Church, then adds some
practical lessons drawn from what
precedes, and gives a table showing
the numerical standing of the church
up to within the last half decade. To
the whole is added an ample index,
thus making the book useful for reference.
To those who desire to arrive
at a concise concept of Methodism, we
can confidently say read it and keep
it for reference. The printer has also
done his duty and the volume presents
a very attractive appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Editor of The Archive</span>:&mdash;After
an absence of nearly three years I visited
this month the place of my college
days, my Alma Mater. Though strange
faces meet one on every hand, yet 'tis
the place that makes friends of us all.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now, Mr. Editor, as you see,
this short letter is directed to you, but
I am also addressing myself to the
Alumni of Trinity College, and especially
to those of '85. The Alumni
of this college are many. They are
scattered far and wide throughout our
State, and all no doubt at the present
rejoice as they recognize a bright future
for this college. Yes, the future
<i>is</i> bright, but not yet reached. New
men have been put in to fill long
standing vacancies, professors of learning
and integrity. The number of students
is increasing, and with it reviving
the whole community; and mighty efforts
are being made in securing an
endowment fund. But we must not stop
here without hailing with delight and
pride the noble enterprise set on foot
by the students themselves. For no
outsider can be said to be the originator.
An undertaking it is that reflects
worth an honor not only on the students
but also on the Alumni who will
respond to the solicitations of these
students.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are one hundred students who
have obligated themselves to stand, I
mean each one of the hundred, for the
sum of fifty dollars, payable at a time
not as yet determined upon, making,
as will be seen, the sum of five thousand
dollars, which amount is to be used in
the erection of a new building for the
Society Halls and for other purposes.
Any one who wishes to contribute can
send check for any amount to any one
of the hundred.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whose duty is it to respond first? I
say it is the duty of the Alumni. The
faculty may teach, the preachers may
preach, the students may come, but
the strength of the institution lies in
the Alumni. As the tree, so is everything
judged by its products. I wish
it could be said that the class of '85
gave more money to Trinity College
than any other class that has ever
left the institution.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have placed my name opposite the
sum of fifty dollars to go in aid of the
new Building, and I hope, as I am the
first of the class of '85, I will not be
the last.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Trustees are working faithfully
for the Endowment Fund, and let the
students continue in their good work,
so heartily encouraged by Prof. English,
who has given the granite free of
charge, a gift that will long stand a
monument to his noble character and
unwavering hope for the institution in
which he is now an instructor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most respectfully,</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Paul Jones</span>.</p>
